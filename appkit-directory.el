;;; appkit-directory.el --- Sectioned directory surfaces -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; A protocol-neutral, non-recursive directory surface.  Applications project
;; their domain hierarchy into a visible flat stream of sections, groups,
;; items, notes, and spacers.  Appkit owns stable reconciliation, fold state,
;; semantic position, exact row activation, and item navigation.  Every item
;; belongs to a section; its group key is optional so sections may own items
;; directly as well as through a full section/group/item path.

ENTRY-INSERTER receives SURFACE and every non-spacer ENTRY after Appkit has
inserted indentation and an optional fold marker.  A non-nil return value
means that it handled the entry by inserting exactly one newline-terminated
physical row.  A nil return value falls through to ITEM-INSERTER for item
entries, or to Appkit's default label renderer otherwise.  ITEM-INSERTER also
receives SURFACE and one item ENTRY and must insert exactly one terminated
physical row.  ACTIVATE-FUNCTION receives SURFACE and an item whose primary
action is item activation.  FOLD-FUNCTION receives SURFACE, the fold entry,
and its new expanded state.  ACTION-ROWS-P opts into whole-row text buttons;
ordinary directory modes dispatch through their mode map.  ANCHOR-PROPERTY
defaults to `appkit-directory-key-property'."
